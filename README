Tramp
=====

Tramp is a rails plugin of Martin's Fowler "Accounting Patterns". It includes Account, Event, Accounting Entry, Accounting Transaction and Posting Rule.

It offer also for free a rule engine with a Business Natural Language (BNL) allowing end users to specify and modify the a business logic. This can be coded directly in class (one class for one rule) or in attributes of ActiveRecord's instance (one instance for one rule).


Example
=======

1. Exemple for monetary events

	class MonetaryEvent < ActiveRecord::Base
  
	  include Tramp::Event::InstanceMethods
	  extend Tramp::Event::ClassMethods
  
	  attr_accessor :direct_orders
  
	  rule :monetary_posting_rule

	end
	
	The rule is implemented inside the class method "movement" with the rule method add_collection.
	
	class MonetaryPostingRule < ActiveRecord::Base

	  include Tramp::Rule::InstanceMethods
	  extend Tramp::Rule::ClassMethods

	  movement do |rule|
	    rule.add_collection(:direct_orders)
	  end  

	end
